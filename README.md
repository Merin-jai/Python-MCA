1. Python Programming
1.1. Create a simple calculator in Python.
   
1.2. An electric power distribution company charges domestic customers as
follows: Consumption unit Rate of charge:
1.2.1. 0-200 Rs. 0.50 per unit
1.2.2. 201-400 Rs. 0.65 per unit in excess of 200
1.2.3. 401-600 Rs 0.80 per unit excess of 400
1.2.4. 601 and above Rs 1.00per unit excess of 600
1.2.5. If the bill exceeds Rs. 400, then a surcharge of 15% will be charged,
and the minimum bill should be Rs. 100/-
Create a Python program based on the scenario mentioned above.

1.3. Print the pyramid of numbers using for loops.

1.4. Write a program to find the number and sum of all integers greater than 100
and less than 200 that are divisible by 7.

1.5. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10

1.6. Write a Python program to reverse the digits of a given number and add them
to the original. If the sum is not a palindrome, repeat this procedure.

1.7. Write a menu-driven program that performs the following operations on
strings

1.7.1. Check if the String is a Substring of Another String
1.7.2. Count Occurrences of Character
1.7.3. Replace a substring with another substring
1.7.4. Convert to Capital Letters
